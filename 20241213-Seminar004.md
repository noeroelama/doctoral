# Weight Matrix in GSTAR

## Definition
The weight matrix (“**W**”) in the Generalized Space-Time Autoregressive (GSTAR) model is a mathematical representation of spatial relationships between different locations. Mathematically, it can be viewed as a structured approach to quantifying the influence of one spatial unit on another, expressed through a matrix of coefficients. Each coefficient $w_{ij}$ represents the magnitude of influence that location $j$ exerts on location $i$.

In spatial statistics, the weight matrix enables the incorporation of spatial dependencies by assigning meaningful numerical weights based on factors such as closeness or connectivity. From a graph theory perspective, the weight matrix resembles an adjacency matrix, describing the edges (influence) between nodes (locations) in a spatial network. This dual perspective makes weight matrices both versatile and integral to spatial-temporal modeling like GSTAR.

### Characteristics:
- A square matrix with dimensions equal to the number of locations.
- Element $w_{ij}$ represents the weight of the influence of location $j$ on location $i$.
- Row-normalized such that $\sum_{j} w_{ij} = 1$, ensuring comparability.

## Importance of Weight Matrix
1. **Captures Spatial Dependencies:** Models how locations interact spatially over time, which is crucial in spatial-temporal analysis.
2. **Improves Model Precision:** Enhances predictive performance by incorporating spatial relationships, reducing residuals.
3. **Flexibility:** Can represent various spatial dynamics, including closeness, similarity, or specific influence.
4. **Scalability:** Adapts to large networks efficiently by limiting the number of interactions.

## Methods to Define Weight Matrix

### **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN):**
This method considers only the nearest $k$ neighbors for each location, making it suitable for capturing local spatial dependencies.

#### Weight Calculation:
Step-by-step:
1. **Compute Distance Matrix:** Calculate the geodesic distance between all pairs of locations to form a distance matrix. This can be achieved using several tools and algorithms, such as:
   - **Haversine Formula:** Computes the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere based on their latitude and longitude.
   - **Geopy Library (Python):** Automates distance calculations using geodesic or great-circle methods.
2. **Identify Nearest Neighbors:** For each location $i$:
   - Sort the distances to all other locations in ascending order.
   - Select the $k$ nearest neighbors (excluding $i$ itself).
3. **Assign Weights:**
   - Assign equal weights of $\frac{1}{k}$ to each of the $k$ nearest neighbors.
   - For non-neighbors, set the weight to 0.
4. **Normalize Rows (Optional):** Ensure that the sum of weights for each row equals 1.

#### Formula:
$$
    w_{ij} = \begin{cases}
    \frac{1}{k} & \text{if } j \text{ is among the k-nearest neighbors of } i, \\
    0 & \text{otherwise.}
    \end{cases}
$$

#### Example Calculation:
Consider 3 cities $A$, $B$, and $C$:
- Distances: $d_{AB} = 10$, $d_{AC} = 20$, $d_{BC} = 15$.
- $k = 1$: Each city connects to its single nearest neighbor.
  - For $A$: Nearest is $B$, so $w_{AB} = 1$, $w_{AC} = 0$.
  - For $B$: Nearest is $A$, so $w_{BA} = 1$, $w_{BC} = 0$.
  - For $C$: Nearest is $B$, so $w_{CB} = 1$, $w_{CA} = 0$.


There are some benefits of K-NN method, which are:
- Reflect direct relationships by focusing only on the closest neighbors.
- Reduces complexity by limiting connections.
- Simple to compute and interpret, particularly for small networks.

### **K-NN Weight Matrix Example (k = 3):**

The choice of $k$ in K-NN significantly influences the weight matrix and, subsequently, the GSTAR model results. A smaller $k$ emphasizes local spatial dependencies, ensuring that each location interacts primarily with its closest neighbors. This can enhance model specificity but risks neglecting broader regional trends.

Conversely, a larger $k$ incorporates more distant neighbors, potentially capturing wider spatial influences. However, this may weaken local effects and introduce noise, especially if distant locations have weaker correlations.

We must carefully balance $k$ based on the study's objectives and the spatial characteristics of the dataset. RMSE, AIC, BIC, and other test can be done to check the optimal $k$. Here we present $k=3$ as follow:

## Conclusion
The weight matrix is a critical component of GSTAR modeling, enabling it to account for spatial relationships effectively. Methods like K-NN provide a straightforward perspective on how locations influence one another based on closeness. By selecting the appropriate method and $k$, we can enhance model accuracy and interpretability. Additionally, using real-world examples such as Ehime’s cities highlights the practical application of spatial modeling in geographically diverse areas.
