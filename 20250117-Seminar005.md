# Enhanced Spatial Weight Matrix

### 1. **Introduction**

In spatial modeling, traditional two-dimensional (2D) weight matrices only account for horizontal relationships between locations. However, real-world phenomena, such as water flow, air pollution, and ecological patterns, often depend on both horizontal distances and vertical differences, such as elevation. Ignoring height can lead to oversimplified models and inaccurate predictions. 

This presentation introduces the Enhanced Spatial Weight Matrix (ESWM), a method to integrate height data into spatial models, making them more realistic and accurate. We simplify complex concepts so that they are easier to understand and apply, while still capturing essential details.

### 2. **Concept of the Enhanced Spatial Weight Matrix**

#### Limitations of 2D Spatial Weight Matrices
Traditional weight matrices rely on horizontal distances, calculated using Euclidean distance:

$$
d_{ij} = \sqrt{(x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2}
$$

where:
- $d_{ij}$ is the distance between locations $i$ and $j$,
- $x_i, y_i$ and $x_j, y_j$ are the coordinates of the two locations.

This ignores height differences, which are critical for many environmental and geographical applications.

#### Model Gravity as the Basis for Height Weight Matrix
The idea of incorporating height into spatial relationships is inspired by the spatial gravity model, which describes interactions between two locations based on their "mass" and distance. The general form of the gravity model is:

$$
F_{ij} = G \cdot \frac{m_i \cdot m_j}{d_{ij}^\beta}
$$

where:
- $F_{ij}$ represents the strength of interaction between locations $i$ and $j$,
- $m_i, m_j$ are the masses (or attributes) of the locations,
- $d_{ij}$ is the distance between them,
- $\beta$ controls the sensitivity to distance,
- $G$ is a scaling constant.

Inspired by this, the height-based weight matrix introduces elevation as a significant factor. Instead of mass, the elevation difference $|l_i - l_j|$ determines the interaction, leading to:

$$
h_{ij} = \frac{1}{b \cdot (|l_i - l_j| + \epsilon)^a}
$$

where $a$ and $b$ play roles analogous to $\beta$ and $G$, adjusting sensitivity and scaling, respectively.

### 3. **Refinements and Practical Adjustments**

#### Height-Based Weight Adjustment Cases
The function $h_{ij}$ describes the spatial weight between two locations based on their elevation and distance. 

In the first case, when the two locations $i$ and $j$ have the same elevation ($l_i = l_j$) but are distinct ($i \neq j$), the spatial weight is assigned the maximum value of $h_{ij} = 1$. This reflects a full spatial relationship, indicating that locations at the same elevation are highly connected regardless of their geographical distance. 

On the other hand, when $i = j$, meaning the location is compared with itself, the spatial weight is set to $h_{ij} = 0$. This avoids redundancy in the spatial weighting matrix since a location cannot influence itself.

The third case occurs when the two locations $i$ and $j$ are at different elevations ($l_i \neq l_j$) and the Euclidean distance between them ($d_{ij}$) is less than or equal to the average distance ($d$). In this scenario, the spatial weight is determined by $h_{ij} = \frac{1}{b |l_i - l_j|^a}$, where $|l_i - l_j|$ represents the absolute difference in elevation, and $a$ and $b$ are parameters controlling the sensitivity to elevation differences. This relationship implies that the closer the elevations, the stronger the spatial influence, while greater elevation differences result in lower weights. The inclusion of the average distance ensures that this condition applies only to nearby locations, where elevation differences have a significant impact.

Finally, in the fourth case, when the two locations $i$ and $j$ have different elevations ($l_i \neq l_j$) but their Euclidean distance exceeds the average distance ($d_{ij} > d$), the spatial weight is set to $h_{ij} = 1$. Here, elevation differences are disregarded for distant locations, and the relationship is treated as uniform. This reflects the assumption that beyond a certain distance, spatial influence is less sensitive to elevation variations.

Therefore, the simpler formula can be obtain from the cases above as follow:

$$
h_{ij} =
\begin{cases} 
1, & \text{if } l_i = l_j, \forall i \neq j \\
0, & \text{if } l_i = l_j, \forall i = j \\
\displaystyle\frac{1}{b|l_i - l_j|^a}, & \text{if } l_i \neq l_j, d_{ij} \leq d \\
1, & \text{if } l_i \neq l_j, d_{ij} > d
\end{cases}
$$

#### Combining Horizontal and Vertical Influences
The Enhanced Spatial Weight Matrix integrates the 2D spatial weight matrix $S_{ij}$ and the height weight matrix $H_{ij}$ using Hadamard multiplication:

$$
WSH_{ij} = S_{ij} \cdot H_{ij}
$$

The final weight matrix is normalized to ensure row sums equal 1:

$$
WMod_{ij} = \frac{WSH_{ij}}{\sum_{j=1}^N WSH_{ij}}
$$

### 4. **Benefits of the Enhanced Spatial Weight Matrix**

#### Accuracy in Predictions
By incorporating height, the ESWM improves model predictions for phenomena influenced by elevation, such as water levels, flood risks, and species distribution.

#### Flexibility
The adjustable parameters $a$ and $b$ allow the ESWM to be customized for various datasets and applications.

#### Simplicity
Despite its added complexity, the ESWM is easy to compute and integrate into existing models. Its use of standard mathematical operations ensures compatibility with common modeling systems.

### 5. **Applications**

#### Urban Planning
Designing infrastructure in hilly regions, considering both horizontal proximity and height differences.

#### Ecology
